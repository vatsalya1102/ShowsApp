## Details

- This project, to create a Movie/Show website, was assigned to me by QuadB Tech, where I have applied for internship role. This project has compelled me to further improve my knowledge of ReactJS while also pushing me to learn new technologies.

- I had done fetching API and using it in some of my previous projects, so I was comfortable with it, as QuadB Tech had already provided the API.

- I chose a minimalistic design for the UI and I hope it is attractive and user friendly.

- I believe this project delivers the expectations that the company has from me. Feel free to reach out to me for any queries and suggestions.
